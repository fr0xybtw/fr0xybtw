👋 Hi, I'm Ali — a student developer and aspiring engineer passionate about clean energy, robotics, and embedded systems.

I design hardware–software systems for hydrogen-powered RC cars, build dashboards for real-time telemetry, and enjoy tackling complex engineering challenges. I also run coding and robotics initiatives to help other students get into tech.

🌟 Key Achievements:
• Selected for the Azerbaijan National Team — H2GP World Finals 2025  
• Founded school Coding Club & initiated the creation of the Robotics Club  
• 5+ years of experience in competitive robotics (VEX, FLL, Drone Racing, H2GP)  
• Built full ESP32 telemetry stack with live React dashboard, sensor integration, and efficiency monitoring  
• Completed multiple CS and cybersecurity courses (edX, Udemy)

🛠 Tech Stack:
Python • C++ • MicroPython • ESP32 • ESP-NOW • React • Sensors & I/O • Data visualization • Hardware debugging

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced embedded development, renewable energy systems, and algorithm design.

📬 Open to collaborations on embedded, robotics, and energy-tech projects.
